    <h1>李雨浓</h1>
    <h1>Yunong Li</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Yunong Li from Beijing, China. I attended the High School Affiliated with Renmin University from 2013 to 2019 for both middle and high school. 
        Afterward, I spent my freshman year at UC Davis before transferring to the University of Toronto, where I completed my undergraduate studies in 2024. 
        I am now planning to pursue my graduate studies at the University of Waterloo. I am majoring in Math and Computer Science, with a strong focus on Math, 
        and I aim to pursue a Ph.D. in Math in the future, although I am currently enrolled in a Master's program.</p>
    <p>I have a variety of hobbies. I enjoy playing Rubik's Cubes, pen spinning, and cardistry. I also play many sports, with basketball being my favorite, 
        but I can play most ball games. I'm an enthusiastic gamer, recently playing games like LOL, Genshin Impact, CS2, KOF (especially KOF97 and KOF15), 
        Honor of Kings, Crazyracing Kartrider (I prefer the old version over KartRider: Drift), and Minecraft. Additionally, I have an interest in poker, 
        specifically, Texas Hold 'em. If you share any of these interests, let's play together!</p>
